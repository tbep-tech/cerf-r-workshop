No prior experience is needed. The workshop content will include a mix of instructor led demonstrations and hands-on exercises designed to reinforce core principles of the programming language. Additional emphasis will be placed on using RStudio as the preferred platform for working with data in a project-based environment. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have the necessary foundation for continued learning to further build R skills.",

We will also use the stickies to indicate progress on exercises (green means okay, red means I need help).\nPlease use RStudio Cloud or your own installation of RStudio during this workshop. The setup instructions for RStudio Cloud are here and for RStudio installation here. You may use one or the other, but we recommend RStudio Cloud for the training.\nWe have a live coding link that we’ll be using as we go through the lessons. If you get lost, you can copy/paste code from this link into RStudio.\nAll training content is on this website. We will be covering the content directly on the website, so if you get lost you can view the agenda to see which lesson we’re covering and find where we’re at by scrolling through the content.\nEach lesson has it’s own R script that is linked at the top. If you are not using the live coding link, you can download the lesson R script and use that directly.\nFinally, if you are not using RStudio Cloud, please make sure to download the required datasets here and make sure you have the the tidyverse, sf, and mapview packages installed. See the setup instructions for details.\n\nAll exercises and breaks will be timed to make sure that we stay on schedule. We’ll display a timer on the screen to track progress.",
